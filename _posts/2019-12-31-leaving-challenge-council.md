title: Leaving the KA Challenge Council

Unfortunately, my time on the Challenge Council has come to an end. My daily use of Khan Academy has declined since I joined the council 2 years ago. And recently I haven't been particularly active on the Challenge Council.

As I step away from KA and the Challenge Council, I will be focusing instead on other projects, like **[launching OurJSEditor](launching-ourjseditor)**. I am not leaving the community, and will continue to use KA, maintain the KA Extension, and hopefully enter a contest or make more programs on KA.

The Challenge Council is left in capable hands, and I look forward to seeing the contest prompts for next year.
