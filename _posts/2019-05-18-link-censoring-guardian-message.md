For a little while I had a link to a [previous post](emoji-link-censoring-bypass) in my bio (using an emoji-domain link-shortener; this was a while before my last post). However, I recived a Gaurdian message because of this, the text of which is below:

> Hi, this is Davin V Jones. We're happy to have you using and contributing to Khan Academy.
> 
> We're working hard to make sure that our video discussions are high quality, and we notice that you've made some off-topic posts. Specifically, bypassing the link filter using emojis is a violation of KA guidelines.
> 
> Please remove any links from your posts and profile.
> 
> Thanks for your help, and we look forward to great contributions from you!
> 
> Davin V Jones

A couple of interesting things to note here. First, I haven't heard of Davin Jones before. Either he isn't an active moderator in the CS side of the site, or I'm just not that in touch (which is more likely). Second, the comment I posted which had an emojified-link I very quickly deleted--I think it's unlikely he saw that. More likely is it that he saw my bio and the "you've made some off-topic posts" is a standard text. Third, he does explicitly call out what I'm doing, which is always good. It isn't entirely a copy-pasted message.

Fourth, "bypassing the link filter using emojis is a violation of KA guidelines." This statement just isn't true. The community guidelines didn't, to my knowledge update when the link-censoring went into effect. I guessed the link censoring mechanism was only a measure to help enforce rules already in place about linking to obviously problematic content (see my earlier posts). It was not clearly communicated that this was a tightening of the actual rules. [Josh](https://khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_724017587964593627235978) had formerly offered to un-hind a comment I had made that got hidden for including a link.

I understand that my attempts to "bypass" the system aren't welcome, and I don't blame KA for that. I'm not planning on putting more links to the KA Hearth in my bio anytime soon. However, it's still unclear to me if KA actually made a decision to crack down on links, or if this is more reactionary moderating. It seems to me most likely that the guardian team reported issues with links and asked KA to help. The developers then probably decided the best solution was the current link censoring, which they implemented. The guardians are now enforcing this "no-links" rule as if it's part of the guidelines, when it came out of a very specific issue. As a user, this is very frustrating, and it contributes to the same problems KA has always had with overly strict moderation and with lack of discoverability for programs.

I reiterate what I said when this change was first introduced. I hope that KA remembers that it was a fix to one specific issue, and I hope that in a year or two (I plan on still being on here), KA considers undoing this change.
