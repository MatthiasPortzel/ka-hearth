My goal with the KA Hearth is to create a place to follow for news about KA, particularly the computer science section.
I hear a lot and read a lot about this, but don't really talk about it.

I also want to try to provide some analysis, to contribute my own opinions and views. I think I'm uniquely qualified to do this, because I have been a member of the Khan Academy computer programming section for so long, and there are only a few active KACS users that know more about coding than I do.

This central topic is intentionally left vague. I expect to write some about:
 - Using the KA internal API
 - Changes KA makes to their website as a whole
 - Issues and activity on the Khan Academy live editor
 - Drama on the Khan Academy Discord server
 - Contests created by the Challenge Council
 - The occasional outstanding KA program
 - Whatever else strikes my fancy

I'm aiming to write around 3 posts a week, most fairly short, just a couple of paragraphs.
