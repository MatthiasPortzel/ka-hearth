KA has updated again, as the website increasingly becomes blue. This change includes new styles for the buttons like "Save" and "Restart" as well as others in the Live Editor container. They were previously previewed by Pamela [on Github](https://github.com/Khan/live-editor/pull/669). In my opinion, this update makes the normal website look even worse, since some buttons have this new blue outline style, but the ones near under the about tab still don't. Hopefully they'll be updated soon.

This also marks the live editor on the website being deployed to the most recent version, 7fe3892. One change I want to mention between now

Oh yeah, and the KA Extension needs to be updated.

Images of past revisions can be seen in my [earlier post]({{ "/posts/KA-is-more-blue" | relative_url }}), for those of you with short memories.
