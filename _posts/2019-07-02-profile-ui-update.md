title: Bio UI update
layout: default
---

KA updated a couple of weeks ago to change the UI layout of user profiles and bios. I first noticed this change on June 18th. Below are screenshots before and after the changes. Prominent is the deemphasis of usernames. Visually, they now appear to be part of the bio.

This change was made in an attempt to bring the user profile page more in-line with the UI of the rest of the site. Overall, I think this change was a positive one. Profiles now look better on small screens (ie mobile), the bio now warps underneath the avatar; before it didn't show up if there wasn't room next to it. The fact that the username is now indistinguishable from the bio is unfortunate. I think KA should have applied in line styling to it, either italics or a lighter color, and that would have helped a lot.
