Typing a new location in the box is supposed to propagate a list of valid locations from the Google Maps API and allow you to chose one. Currently, the request for possible locations is failing because KA isn’t using an API key, something Google requires so that they can bill people making a large number of requests. (That is, Khan Academy trying to use the free tier of the Maps API, and Google wants them to pay.)</p>\n\n"},{"url":"/posts/3D-on-KA","date":"2018-10-23 00:00:00 -0700","slug":"3D-on-KA","title":"All 3D on KA is bad","excerpt":"<p>I am very proud of the 3D effect I created for Terra Magma.
