I'm Matthias. I joined Khan Academy to practice math in 2011, and quickly moved on to programming. After several years of programming and creating games on KA, I created Terra Magma, which got over 3000 votes and is currently 17th on the top list. I documented a lot of the Khan Academy internal API, and have provided help and answered questions for people trying to use this API. I started OurJSEditor (along with a couple of other KA users) to try to create a better home for KA's community. I've worked on the unofficial Khan Academy Extension, and I was member of the KA Challenge Council for the first 2 years of its existence.
